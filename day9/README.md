In this task, we leverage Depth-First Search (DFS) to navigate through the tree of sequences. The traversal starts from the top and descends to the lower levels, returning the extrapolation of the lower levels to the higher ones.

## Part One - DFS ⭐⭐

Pretty much the same as in part one, but this time we extrapolating the left side.
